1. ### Lecture Notes file name
    Please put your `week number`. If the Lecture note have many parts, put it in one folder

    #### Example
    ```
    [Week 09] LogicProof Theory.pdf
    [Week 10] Gates.pdf
    ```
    if you are not sure about which week
    ```
    [Week XX] Gates.pdf
    ```
1. ### Tutorial, Lab and Assignment file Name
    Please put your `week number`. 
    #### Example
    ```
    [Week 09][Tutorial] LogicProof Theory.pdf
    [Week 02][Assignment] Permutations.pdf
    [Week 07][Lab] Object Oriented.pdf
